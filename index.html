          <li>Your phone and your PC both need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</li>
          <code class="note"><span class="bold">Note</span>: You can also use Phone Link if you connect your pc to your phone's hotspot.</code>
          <p>For convenience, you can repeatedly connect to your phone's hotspot without having to provide a password every time using the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/phone-link-requirements-and-setup-cd2a1ee7-75a7-66a6-9d4e-bf22e735f9e3" target="_blank">Instant Hotspot</a> feature.</p>
          <code class="note"><span class="bold">Note</span>: Mobile data charges may apply.</code>
          </code>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend always having the latest version of Windows installed to make sure you get the best experience with the Phone Link.</p>
