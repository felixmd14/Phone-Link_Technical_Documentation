# 💻 Technical Documentation Page Project

This is a **Technical Documentation Page** built as the third project in freeCodeCamp’s **Responsive Web Design Certification**. This page documents how to connect an Android phone to a Windows PC using the Phone Link (Link to Windows) app.

## 📝 Description

The documentation explains the setup process for linking your Android device to your Windows PC, system requirements, step-by-step pairing instructions, key features, and references. The page demonstrates using semantic HTML, navigation menus, and responsive design principles.

## 💡 Features

- **Fixed side navigation bar** for quick access to different documentation sections
- Clean, structured content with headings, paragraphs, lists, and inline links
- Code blocks and note sections for highlighting instructions and important details
- Responsive design that adapts to smaller screens (mobile and tablet-friendly)
- Accessible and readable layout with clear hierarchy

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the documentation page.
3. Click the navigation links to jump to different sections of the documentation.

## 🗂️ File Structure


- **index.html** — Contains the structure and content of the technical documentation.
- **styles.css** — Contains the styling for layout, navigation, code blocks, and responsiveness.
- **README.md** — Project description and instructions (this file).

## 💬 Future Improvements

- Add an interactive table of contents that highlights the currently active section
- Include diagrams or flowcharts illustrating the connection process
- Add collapsible sections to make long content easier to navigate
- Improve accessibility further with ARIA roles and enhanced keyboard navigation
